/**
 * The "dto" (Data Transfer Object) package contains data structures
 * used for transferring data between different layers of the movie
 * booking application.
 * <p>
 * DTOs within this package represent simplified and serializable
 * objects that facilitate the exchange of data between the presentation
 * layer, service layer, and external interfaces. These objects often
 * mirror specific subsets of entity attributes to fulfill specific
 * functionality or communication requirements.
 * <p>
 * Organizing DTOs in this package helps in maintaining separation
 * of concerns, enhancing modularity, and ensuring clean data transfer
 * across various parts of the movie booking system.
