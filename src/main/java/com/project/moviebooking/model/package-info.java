/**
 * The "model" package houses the domain model classes representing
 * entities and data structures used within the movie booking application.
 * <p>
 * Model classes in this package encapsulate the core business entities,
 * data structures, and relationships that model the movie booking domain.
 * These classes define the structure and behavior of data elements used
 * within the application, representing real-world concepts and entities.
 * <p>
 * Organizing model classes in this package helps maintain a clear separation
 * between business entities and the rest of the application, facilitating
 * clean data modeling and improving the overall design and readability
 * of the movie booking system.
