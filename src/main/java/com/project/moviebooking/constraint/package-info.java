/**
 * The "constraint" package contains custom constraints and validations
 * utilized within the movie booking application.
 * <p>
 * Custom constraints defined in this package represent specific validation
 * rules and constraints applied to various entities or fields within the
 * movie booking system. These constraints provide specialized validation
 * logic beyond standard Java or framework annotations.
 * <p>
 * Constraints here are designed to ensure data integrity, enforce business
 * rules, and validate input parameters based on application-specific requirements.
