 * Exception classes in this package represent specific error conditions,
 * faults, or exceptional scenarios that may occur during the execution

 * detailed error information and are thrown to handle exceptional cases
 * and provide meaningful error messages to users or client applications.

 * Organizing exception classes in this package helps centralize and
 * manage custom exception handling, enabling precise error handling and
 * effective communication of error conditions within the application.
