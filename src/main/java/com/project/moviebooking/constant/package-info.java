/**
 * The "constant" package stores constants and enumerations used throughout
 * the movie booking application.
 * <p>
 * Constants and enumerations in this package represent fixed values, flags,
 * or predefined types that are used consistently across various parts of the
 * application. These values remain unchanged during runtime and serve as
 * reference points for specific functionalities or configurations.
 * <p>
 * Organizing constants and enumerations in this package helps centralize
 * and manage these values, promoting maintainability and ensuring uniformity
 * in their usage across different modules of the movie booking system.
