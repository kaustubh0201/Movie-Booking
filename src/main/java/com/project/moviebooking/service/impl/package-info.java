/**
 * The "impl" (Implementation) package contains concrete implementations
 * of service interfaces responsible for executing business logic and
 * operations within the movie booking application.
 * <p>
 * Service implementation classes in this package provide the actual
 * implementations for the service interfaces defined in the "service"
 * package. These implementations contain the logic and functionality
 * to fulfill specific business requirements and interact with repositories,
 * external systems, or other components.
 * <p>
 * Organizing service implementations in this package helps maintain a
 * clear separation between service interfaces and their concrete
 * implementations, promoting modularity and ease of maintenance
 * within the movie booking system.
