/**
 * The "repository" package contains repository interfaces and classes
 * responsible for interacting with data storage and performing CRUD
 * operations within the movie booking application.
 * <p>
 * Repository interfaces and implementations in this package define
 * contracts for accessing and managing persistent data entities. These
 * repositories often utilize underlying frameworks or libraries to
 * communicate with the database or data storage layer, providing
 * data access functionality to other parts of the application.
 * <p>
 * Organizing repositories in this package helps maintain a clear separation
 * of concerns, promoting modular and testable data access operations
 * within the movie booking system.
